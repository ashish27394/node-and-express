*Dealing with node versions
For specific project we might need specific version of node
For that we can use node version manager(nvm)
nvm-windows

*npmrc is the cofiguration file for npm
like install the exact version

************** module 2 finished *****************
************** module 3*****************

*debugging node js
*chalk - chalk provides different color for different results
like green for build successful,
red for unsuccessful build and etc....

*debug - debug can be worked as an alternative to console.log
The difference between debug and console.log is that debug will only 
work in debug mode and not in production mode.

To run debug for specific file we have to import it that file and say that where we are
var debug = require('debug')('app');
Here we are saying we are in 'app' file.
So debug will show the message like 
ex --> app <whatever msg>

express also uses debug so debug will also return the express if it present.

To run in debug mode 
command in windows is --> set DEBUG=* & node app.js
Here * means it will debug everything and show lot of messages in the console 
You can specify the file you want to debug in place of * to remove the unnecessary noice(results)
from the debug package in the console
ex - set DEBUG=app & node app.js

*morgan - morgan will track all the request for the website
i.e. traffic tracking
It will give you info about from where request generated
express is using morgan as a middleware
app.use(morgan('combined')); --> For detailed info
app.use(morgan('tiny')); --> For small info
,etc and many more
